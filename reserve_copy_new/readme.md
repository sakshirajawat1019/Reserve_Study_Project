# Project Description
It is a Project in which any user know the thirty year expenditure of any propery or anything

# Installation
Install Python: Django is a Python web framework, so you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

# Create a Virtual Environment: 
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Django project. A virtual environment allows you to isolate the Python packages required by your project from your system's global Python installation. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
Install Django: With the virtual environment activated, you can now install Django using the Python package manager, pip. Execute the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
pip install django
Start a New Django Project: Once Django is installed, you can create a new Django project. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the desired directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
django-admin startproject myproject
This will create a new directory called myproject with the basic project structure and files.

Run Database Migrations: Django uses a database to store its data. By default, it uses SQLite, but you can configure it to use other databases as well. To initialize the database and apply any initial migrations, run the following commands:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
cd myproject
python manage.py migrate
Run the Development Server: To run the development server and test your Django project, execute the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
python manage.py runserver
This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000, and you can access your Django project in your web browser.


Install PostgreSQL: Download and install PostgreSQL from the official website (https://www.postgresql.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Create a Database: Once PostgreSQL is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and access the PostgreSQL command line interface by running the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
psql -U postgres
This will open the PostgreSQL command prompt. Now, create a new database for your Django project by executing the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
Replace mydatabase with the desired name for your database.

Install psycopg2: Django uses the psycopg2 package to connect to PostgreSQL. Activate your project's virtual environment (if you're using one) and install psycopg2 by running the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
pip install psycopg2
Configure Django Settings: Open your Django project's settings file (myproject/settings.py) in a text editor. Locate the DATABASES section and update it with the following configuration:

<!-- python
Copy code -->
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'reserve_study',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '',  # Set your PostgreSQL password if applicable
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

Run Database Migrations: With the PostgreSQL database configured, navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal or command prompt and run the following command to apply any pending database migrations:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
python manage.py migrate
Start the Development Server: Finally, start the development server and test your Django project with PostgreSQL. Run the following command:

<!-- bash
Copy code -->
python manage.py runserver
Your Django project is now running with PostgreSQL as the database backend.

That's it! You have successfully set up a Django project with PostgreSQL. Django will now use the PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving data. Make sure to refer to the Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/) for more information on working with databases and configuring Django settings.
